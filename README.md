# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

🎯 Objective
Detect fraudulent transactions with high precision and recall while minimizing false positives.
Key goals include:
--> Handling class imbalance
--> Evaluating model with real-world metrics
--> Preparing for real-time deployment

🛠️ Technologies Used
--> Python (Jupyter / Google Colab)
--> NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
--> Matplotlib, Seaborn
--> Logistic Regression 

📊 Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
--> Null value check, feature scaling, class distribution analysis

2. Undersampling
--> Balance data by taking equal samples of fraudulent and legit transactions

3. Model Building
--> Logistic Regression trained on the balanced dataset

4. Evaluation
--> Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

📈 Results
| Metric        | Score                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Accuracy      | \~97%                          |
| Precision     | High (depends on seed/sample)  |
| Recall        | High (focus on catching fraud) |
| ROC-AUC Score | \~0.98+                        |

--> Model performance may vary slightly depending on data split and sampling.
